	- Define ambiguity in the context of speech
	- **Suggested Activity**: Experiment with various interpretations of ambiguous words e.g. "Stolen Painting Found By Tree"
	- **Suggested Subject**: English
### Unit 3: Representing and Reasoning
1. **Representing the world**
	- Identify how symbols can take place of words to represent meaning
	- **Suggested Activity**: Show how maps can represent their city/home.
	- **Suggested Subject**: Maths / English
2. **Making decisions**
	- Use a decision tree to map out all possible ways of doing an activity (playing tic-tac-toe, making a sandwich etc.
	- Show that the "best move" can be found in a game by leading to a position that has a better chance of winning
	-  Define the following words in context to a tree: nodes, root node, parent, leaves, terminal/non-terminal nodes
	- **Suggested Activity**: Use a decision tree to map out all possible states of a half filled Tic-Tac Toe board. Now figure out what the "Best moves" are.
	- **Suggested Subject**: Maths / Science
### Unit 4: Learning
1. **How do we learn?**
	- Differentiate between how people learn and how computers learn.
	- Define supervised learning and reinforcement learning
	- Explain how a decision tree can be updated when "learning" until it gives a favourable answer
	- **Suggested Subject** : Technology / Math / Science
2. **Neural networks**
	- Explain how humans recognise objects based on several small details that may be unknown to other people
	- Explain how computers can factor in several inputs (called **nodes**) to make a decision
	- Define the weight as a representation of how important a node is
	- Explain how an neural network "learns" by changing its weight to give a better result
	- **Suggested Activity**: Acting like a villain in a movie/TV series, describe data sets that would disadvantage the main character of the story. Try and do the opposite: using a description/sample of the dataset, figure out which biases may arise if an AI was trained on the data
	- **Suggested Subject**: Science / Technology
	
3. **Learning from data**
	- Explain how AI learns from the quality of how its trained
	- Explain how AI reacts unpredictably when it is in an unfamiliar environment
	- Explain how much context is needed to train an AI on a classification (e.g. a agent trained to identify dogs purely based on small dogs might be inaccurate when shown a picture of a husky, or a blueberry muffin)
	- **Suggested Activity**: Train a machine learning classification agent (eg. Teachable machine) by preparing a dataset. What happens when you show it a picture from different contexts?
	- **Offline Alternative Activity**: Write a reflection on how you learn names of objects around you, and how you react when you see something you don't know the name of
	- **Suggested Subject**: Science / Technology
4. Biases
	 - Define biases in the context of AI models
	 - Explain how biases can arise in AI models due to the quality of training data
	 - Differentiate between a biased and unbiased data set
	 - **Suggested Activity**: Acting like a villain in a movie/TV series, describe data sets that would disadvantage the main character of the story. Try and do the opposite: using a description/sample of the dataset, figure out which biases may arise if an AI was trained on the data
	- **Suggested Subject**: Science / Technology
### Unit 5: Natural Interactions
 1. **Seeing the world differently**
	- Differentiate between how AI and living beings sense the world
	- Understand that AI and Humans think differently about the same task
	- **Suggested Subject**: English / HASS / Science
2. **Language and emotion**	- Explain how AI can detect tone and emotion in text, or emotions in faces
	- Explain how homophones and homonyms can create ambiguity in language
	- Explain how *context* can help resolve ambiguity
	- Explain how AI generated text and images "feel" different to human generated ones
	- **Suggested Activity**: Experiment with a speech to text system to see if it can accurately identify which word to use based on context
	- **Suggested Subject**: English
3.  **Reasoning**
	- Explain how currently, a singular AI model cannot do everything (e.g. LLMs are inaccurate in math)
	- Describe what AI might need to know to understand a story and answer questions about it
	- **Suggested Activity**: Design questions that intelligent systems can answer very well, and others which it can't
	- **Suggested Subject**: Science, HASS
### Unit 6: AI In our Lives
1. **Ethical AI**
	- Evaluate how an AI technology can have different effects on different groups of people.
	-  Discuss the characteristics of systems that are fair and unfair and the impact on people when a system is not fair.
	- Explain how a good AI system is transparent and explainable
	- **Suggested Activity**: Have a class debate on "Should AI...?" e.g. should AI mark my papers?
	- **Suggested Subject**: HASS
2. **AI generated content**
	- Analyse deepfake images or videos from early models and identify the flaws that reveal them as deepfakes
	- Analyse how newer models produce more realistic content.
	- Describe ethical issues that may arise from AI generated media that is indistinguishable from reality 
	- **Suggested Activity**: Perform a class play where the protagonist has supposedly "promised" to do something in a deepfake, ensuring the topic is lighthearted ("Agreed to do the ice bucket challenge on a dare")
	- **Suggested Subject**: HASS
3. **AI generated text**
	- Identify few differences between an AI generated text and a human generated one
	- Describe how AI checkers look for patterns that AI generate that are uncommon in humans
	- State that AI checkers are not completely accurate
	- **Suggested Activity**: Compare AI generated text with human generated text. Are they different? Why? Can you identify texts with 100% certainty every time? Why/Why not?
	- **Suggested Subject**: English
4. **Using AI responsibly**
	- Contrast appropriate and inappropriate situations to use AI 
	- Explain how to prove that AI was not used in their own work
	- Explain the importance of stating that AI was used in AI generated works
	- **Suggested Activity**: Have a class debate on if AI is appropriate in certain situations. (e.g. "Using AI to do schoolwork"  leading exploration of cheating on homework vs. understanding concepts)
	- **Suggested Subject**: HASS, English
5. **AI for Change**
	- Identify current uses for AI and how they have changed society
	- Describe jobs that will change or no longer exist due to the advancement of AI
