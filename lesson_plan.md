# Sample Lesson Plan - Identifying AI Generated Text


### Class
Year 4/5
### Subject 
- English / Writing

### Learning Objectives
- Understand that while AI can mimic human writing, it often lacks human nuance, context, and emotional depth
- Differentiate between AI generated and human generated/realistic content
- Understand current methods and limitations for verifying whether AI was used

### Topics Addressed
- Unit 5.2: Language and emotion
- Unit 6.3: AI generated text

### Materials and Resources
- List of AI generated and human generated short essays (100-150 words), with some on the same topic
- A free "AI checker" tool that can be found online

### Lesson Introduction / Warm-up
- Show students an essay and guess wether it was AI generated or not (5 minutes). Focus on the emotions and "vibe" of the text instead of actual indicators

### Procedures / Activities
1. In groups, take two essays and identify which one was AI generated. Students will write down reasoning on a worksheet to compare details (tone, details, vocabulary etc.) (15 minutes)
2. As a class, create a "AI vs. Human" chart summarising what was found. (10 minutes)
3. Discuss how even the best indicators are not a 100% accurate ( 10 minutes)
4. Discuss best practices to prove that AI was not used (timestamped copies, no copy-paste etc.) ( 5 minutes)
5. Discuss when it is acceptable to use AI in writing (5 minutes)

### Differentiation
- Advanced learners could try to prompt an LLM to create a more human like essay, and then try to differentiate them
- EAL learners could be supported through a visual checklist and their teammates

### Assessment
- Students will write a short reflection on "What helps me spot AI generated content, and why is it unreliable."

### Closure
- Discuss how students can use what they learnt to check for the use of AI, and to prove in their assignments that they have not used AI generated content.
