# Year 1 Syllabus

This syllabus is designed for Year 1 and can be adapted to an year above, or year below as needed. Vocabulary such as *reinforcement, bias, classification model* etc. are included for teacher reference and are not intended to be used in a lesson. Instead, classroom delivery is expected to use simplified, story-based and play-based language which is appropriate to the age group.

The syllabus consists of 6 units, each containing 1-3 subunits. The subunits feature teacher-facing learning objectives describing what students should be capable of doing after the lesson. Most subunits also have a suggested activity to encourage project based learning and a suggested subject to teach the lesson in, both of which can be adapted to the teacher's discretion.

### Unit 1:  What is AI?
  - Understand that AI is generally a computer creating results from patterns it has learnt
	- Outline the resources that are necessary when AI is used
	-  Identify AI and AI-powered tools used in daily life
	- **Suggested Activity**: Create a chart classifying technological tools as AI or not AI
	- **Suggested Subject:** Technologies / Science
### Unit 2:  Perception
1. **Sensing the World**
	- Identify how humans sense the world through ears, eyes etc.
	- Relate sensors of a robot to its "eyes and ears" 
	- Explain the different ways we can interact with the world (touch, sound, speech, text)
	- **Suggested Activity:** As a class, create a picture of a "robot" made up of sensors, labelling what each part is and what it sensors (eg. cameras for eyes to "see", microphones for ears to "hear")
	- **Suggested Subject:**  Science
2. **Hearing words**
	- Describe how  words need to be "processed" to understand it and simply hearing it makes it indistinguishable from noise
	- Identify how certain words can be difficult to understand without context
	- **Suggested Activity:** Play back audio recordings containing different accents, homophones and contexts and try to identify the words from each recording 
	- **Suggested Subject:** English, perhaps as a short addition to a lesson on homophones.
### Unit 3: Representing and Reasoning
1. **Representing the world**
	- Identify how symbols can take place of words to represent meaning
	- **Suggested Activity:** Students will try to "decode" sentences using just emojis
	- **Suggested Subject:** Arts, English, HASS
2. **Making decisions**
	- Explain how every actions are made up of several steps
	- Recall the structure of a decision tree
	- Use a given decision tree to solve a problem
	- **Suggested Activity:** As a class, create a simple decision tree for topics such as "What should I do if it rains?". Then, have students act out scenarios based on the tree
	- **Suggested Subject:** Maths or Science
### Unit 4: Learning
1. **How do we learn?**
	- Explain how humans learn via positive and negative reinforcement
	- Explain how children learn what objects are called through repeated exposure to the name (i.e. an environment with lots of *labels*)
	- Understand the machines can also learn using labels and reinforcement
	- **Suggested Activity**: Learn how to classify arbitrary data that has been labelled. e.g. Red cartoon mushrooms are poisonous, while green cartoon mushrooms are not
	- **Suggested Subject:** Science, HASS
2. **Learning from data**
	- Create a classification model using a tool like *Teachable Machine*
	- Use it to classify objects (e.g. cat and dog)
	- Understand that machines can behave unpredictably when shown something it was not shown during training
	- **Suggested Activity**: Use Teachable Machine to classify simple objects like 'cat' and 'dog'. Observe when and why it misclassifies objects
	- **Offline Alternative Activity**: Continuing the activity in 4.1, how do you react when you see a completely different (yellow) mushroom? What about when you see a snake?
	- **Suggested Subject:** Technologies. Can be adapted to science
### Unit 5: Natural Interactions
 1. **Different ways of thinking**
	- Understand that AI and Humans may think differently about the same task
	- **Suggested Activity**: Have the teacher give simple instructions for a task (e.g., "Make a sandwich") and have students act it out naturally. Then, the teacher acts as an AI, following instructions literally and misinterpreting any ambiguity. Next, students write clear instructions for a new task from prompts, swap with partners, and act like AIs by following the instructions exactly. 
	- **Suggested Subject:** English
2. **Language and emotion**	
	- Understand how AI cannot feel emotions, but can sound like it does
	- Describe what AI might need to know to understand a story and answer questions about it
	- **Suggested Activity**: Compare stories written by humans and AI on humour and emotion. Are they different? Why
	- **Suggested Subject:** English, HASS
3.  **Generalisation**
	- Recall how currently, AI tends to be extremely *specialised*; they tend to be extremely good at only one thing
	- Explain that currently, humans are the only thing that can perform well in almost every situation
	**Suggested Activity**: Act out a class play with a specialised robot and a human in a field a robot is not specialised in (e.g. "ChatGPT tries to sing", "A robot tries to climb stairs", "A robot who doesn't have fingers", "An AI understanding anger") etc.
	**Suggested Subject:** HASS, English
**Suggested Activity**:  Design questions that AI might answer very well, and others which it can't perform as well. Why do these questions prove difficult for AI to solve? 
**NOTE**: Most of these subunits can be taught in the same lesson
	
### Unit 6: AI and Us
1. **Using AI Ethically**
	- Explain AI is not appropriate for use in certain situations
	- List a few situations where it can be useful and others where it is not
	- Understand AI has helped solve many problems but it has also given us many new challenges
	- **Suggested Activity**: Have teacher mandated debates/discussions on whether AI is suitable in a variety of situations. Vote on it as a class ("Is it okay to use AI to say sorry to a friend?")
	- **Suggested Subject:** HASS
2. **AI for Change**
	- Discuss how technology has changed society
	- Describe jobs that have changed or been eradicated because of technology
	- Describe new jobs that have started because of the advancement of technology
	- **Suggested Activity**: Identify a piece of technology that has changed a lot. Create a picture or story of how it might look like in several years.
	- **Suggested Subject:** HASS
