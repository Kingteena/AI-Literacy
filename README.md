# AI-Literacy


## Introduction
The rapid progress of Artificial Intelligence (AI) hasmade it increasingly accessible to the wider commu-nity. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok have experienced growing use, especially among students. However, this also means that many young children arevulnerable to being exposed to AI without suitable supervision, which can result in them using AI without understanding its technical limits or the ethical and social issues related to AI use. Proper AI education (AIEdu) is a crucial part of the digital literacy these children need to navigate a fast-changing digital world, equipping them with the skills to use AI effectively and ethically. This begs the question: How can AI education be made age-appropriate and engaging for younger learners?

While several existing AIEdu frameworks try to approach this gap, perhaps the most prominent being AI4K12, there is evidence that suggest that primary school students (from Kindergarten to year 5) are often overlooked in these frameworks. AI4K12 has seen success taught to high school students, but have been criticised for being too complex for younger gradebands (Yue Yim, 2024). Other existing frameworks also share this criticism while many others completely overlook primary school students. 

Given the success of AI4K12, This respository contains resources for a framework that teaches primary school students knowledge that is assumed for higher grade bands of AI4K12 in a pedagogically sound and age-appropriate manner.
